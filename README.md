# lightbulb
Just a simple JavaScript library for generating random CSS properties, ideal for random lightbulb flickers.

## How to install?
`npm i @dead404code/lightbulbCSS@version` || `npm i git://github.com/DeadCodeGames/lightbulbCSS.git#versionTag`


## How to use? 
I could not bother to *actually* make a module (I am dumb :3), so you cannot just import using `require("@dead404code/lightbulbCSS")` or an `import` statement. Instead, just include it in your HTML, like `<script src="node_modules/@dead404code/lightbulbCSS/index.js">`, and that should work.
